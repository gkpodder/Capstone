\section{Introduction}

The following document details the Module Interface Specifications for
\wss{Fill in your project name and description}

Complementary documents include the System Requirement Specifications
and Module Guide.  The full documentation and implementation can be
found at \url{...}.  \wss{provide the url for your repo}

\section{Notation}

\wss{You should describe your notation.  You can use what is below as
  a starting point.}

The structure of the MIS for modules comes from \citet{HoffmanAndStrooper1995},
with the addition that template modules have been adapted from
\cite{GhezziEtAl2003}.  The mathematical notation comes from Chapter 3 of
\citet{HoffmanAndStrooper1995}.  For instance, the symbol := is used for a
multiple assignment statement and conditional rules follow the form $(c_1
\Rightarrow r_1 | c_2 \Rightarrow r_2 | ... | c_n \Rightarrow r_n )$.

The following table summarizes the primitive data types used by \progname. 

\begin{center}
\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.2}
\noindent 
\begin{tabular}{l l p{7.5cm}} 
\toprule 
\textbf{Data Type} & \textbf{Notation} & \textbf{Description}\\ 
\midrule
character & char & a single symbol or digit\\
integer & $\mathbb{Z}$ & a number without a fractional component in (-$\infty$, $\infty$) \\
natural number & $\mathbb{N}$ & a number without a fractional component in [1, $\infty$) \\
real & $\mathbb{R}$ & any number in (-$\infty$, $\infty$)\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular} 
\end{center}

\noindent
The specification of \progname \ uses some derived data types: sequences, strings, and
tuples. Sequences are lists filled with elements of the same data type. Strings
are sequences of characters. Tuples contain a list of values, potentially of
different types. In addition, \progname \ uses functions, which
are defined by the data types of their inputs and outputs. Local functions are
described by giving their type signature followed by their specification.

\section{Module Decomposition}

The \textbf{Proxi}, is decomposed into a hierarchy of modules following the 
design principles of information hiding and separation of concerns. Each 
module corresponds to a well-defined secret and is independently assignable 
to a developer. The decomposition balances hardware hiding, behaviour 
hiding, and software decision modules.

\begin{table}[H]

\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.2}
\begin{tabular}{p{0.3\textwidth} p{0.65\textwidth}}
\toprule
\textbf{Level 1} & \textbf{Level 2 Modules (Secrets / Responsibilities)}\\
\midrule

\multirow{2}{*}{\textbf{Hardware-Hiding}} &
\textbf{HH-IO (Audio Adapter)} – manages microphone input and audio 
output across different platforms.\\
& \textbf{HH-Auto (System Control)} – performs basic desktop actions 
such as typing, clicking, or launching applications.\\
\midrule

\multirow{7}{*}{\textbf{Behaviour-Hiding}} &
\textbf{BH-Input (Voice \& Text Manager)} – captures user input, 
converts speech to text, and normalizes text commands. Implements 
\textit{FUNC.R.1–R.2}.\\
& \textbf{BH-NLU (Intent Parser)} – interprets text into structured 
intents and parameters based on defined command patterns. Implements 
\textit{FUNC.R.3}.\\
& \textbf{BH-Plan (Task Executor)} – determines which agent or tool 
should handle a command and coordinates its execution. Implements 
\textit{FUNC.R.4}.\\
& \textbf{BH-Safety (Confirmation Gate)} – validates actions that may 
affect files or system settings and requests confirmation. Implements 
\textit{FUNC.R.9}.\\
& \textbf{BH-Session (Context Manager)} – maintains user session data, 
history, and undo information for continuity. Supports 
\textit{FUNC.R.4}.\\
& \textbf{BH-Feedback (Response Manager)} – converts textual responses 
into spoken or visual feedback for the user. Implements 
\textit{FUNC.R.5–R.6}.\\
& \textbf{BH-UI (Proxi Interface)} – presents status updates, 
confirmations, and results; supports full voice-only interaction. 
Implements \textit{FUNC.R.8}.\\
\midrule

\multirow{5}{*}{\textbf{Software-Decision}} &
\textbf{SD-Types (Core Structures)} – defines abstract data types for 
Command, Intent, and Plan.\\
& \textbf{SD-ToolRegistry (Action Map)} – maintains the mapping between 
recognized intents and available system actions.\\
& \textbf{SD-Store (Local Storage)} – handles persistent storage for 
user preferences, session history, and logs.\\
& \textbf{SD-STT/TTS Config} – specifies configuration for speech and 
text synthesis models and supported languages.\\
& \textbf{SD-Log (Event Logger)} – records system actions and feedback 
events for debugging and validation.\\

\textbf{Likely Changes:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item The choice of speech recognition or text-to-speech library 
  (for example, switching from Whisper API to a local model).
  \item Adjustments to the user interface layout or how voice commands 
  trigger visible feedback or audio playback.
  \item Fine-tuning thresholds for speech detection and timing between 
  input and response based on user testing.
  \item Updating supported voice commands or adding new MCP tools as 
  features are expanded.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Unlikely Changes:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item The main processing loop of Input $\rightarrow$ Interpret 
  $\rightarrow$ Plan $\rightarrow$ Execute $\rightarrow$ Feedback.
  \item The core data structures used for storing Commands, Intents, 
  and Action Plans.
  \item The communication pattern between modules through the MCP 
  agent interface.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Traceability to SRS:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{BH-Input} fulfills \textit{FUNC.R.1–R.2}: speech and text 
  input handling with accuracy $\geq 90\%$.
  \item \textbf{BH-NLU} fulfills \textit{FUNC.R.3}: intent recognition 
  accuracy $\geq 90\%$.
  \item \textbf{BH-Plan} fulfills \textit{FUNC.R.4}: agent planning and 
  execution success rate $\geq 85\%$.
  \item \textbf{BH-Feedback} fulfills \textit{FUNC.R.5–R.6}: provides 
  feedback and spoken confirmation within response time $\leq 2\,\text{s}$.
  \item \textbf{BH-UI} fulfills \textit{FUNC.R.8}: supports full hands-free 
  operation for accessibility.
  \item \textbf{BH-Safety} fulfills \textit{FUNC.R.9}: requests confirmation 
  before executing high-risk or destructive actions.
  \item \textbf{Support modules (SD, HH)} enable non-functional goals on 
  latency, reliability, and auditability through structured logging.

\subsection{Syntax}

\subsubsection{Exported Constants}

\subsubsection{Exported Access Programs}

\textbf{Name} & \textbf{In} & \textbf{Out} & \textbf{Exceptions} \\

\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\subsection{Semantics}

\subsubsection{State Variables}

\wss{Not all modules will have state variables.  State variables give the module
  a memory.}

\subsubsection{Environment Variables}

\wss{This section is not necessary for all modules.  Its purpose is to capture
  when the module has external interaction with the environment, such as for a
  device driver, screen interface, keyboard, file, etc.}

\subsubsection{Assumptions}

\wss{Try to minimize assumptions and anticipate programmer errors via
  exceptions, but for practical purposes assumptions are sometimes appropriate.}

\subsubsection{Access Routine Semantics}

\noindent \wss{accessProg}():
\begin{itemize}
\item transition: \wss{if appropriate} 
\item output: \wss{if appropriate} 
\item exception: \wss{if appropriate} 
\end{itemize}

\wss{A module without environment variables or state variables is unlikely to
  have a state transition.  In this case a state transition can only occur if
  the module is changing the state of another module.}

\wss{Modules rarely have both a transition and an output.  In most cases you
  will have one or the other.}

\subsubsection{Local Functions}

\wss{As appropriate} \wss{These functions are for the purpose of specification.
  They are not necessarily something that is going to be implemented
  explicitly.  Even if they are implemented, they are not exported; they only
  have local scope.}
