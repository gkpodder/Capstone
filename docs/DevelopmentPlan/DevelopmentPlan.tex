\section{Team Meeting Plan}
The Team will meet every Wednesday from 4:00PM - 4:45PM in person. Campus library meeting rooms will be booked weekly, depending on availability.
\begin{itemize}
  \item A rotating chair will lead each meeting and prepare the meeting\'s agenda in advance.

  \item Feature requests and Decisions will be documented using Github Issues
  \item Meetings with graduate students speacializing in Human-Computer Interfaces will occur biweekly. These will either be virtual or in-person depending on availability.
\end{itemize}

\section{Team Communication Plan}

Urgent issues or clarifications will be communicated through Discord. Discord will also be used for any virtual meetings between the team. 
Meetings with industry advisors and graduate students will take place over MS Teams if held virtually. 
Github issues will the the source of truth for techincal information and progress tracking.

\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{table}

\section{Workflow Plan}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Each Feature/Bug/Defect will have a Github Issue created for it. This issue will included detailed information along with current progress, assignee and appropriate labels. Github Projects will be used to track all incoming and in-progress issues.
	\item Each Issue will a branch for any associated development work to be done.
	\item Once the author is satisfied with their solution, they can put up a Pull Request to merge their changes into the main branch. Each Pull request must link to one or more issues and have a detailed description of the changes made and the user impact of those changes.
	\item After the Pull Request has been raised and all required pre-submit checks have succeded, the author can add the "Review Needed" label to their PR.
	\item Each PR must have at least 2 reviewers. After the reviewers have approved, the PR can be merged and the associated issues can be closed.
\end{itemize}

\section{Project Decomposition and Scheduling}

The team will use the Kanban Board on Github Projects to track incoming and in-progress issues.
The Board for the project can be found here: TODO:ADD LINK HERE.

\section{Proof of Concept Demonstration Plan}

What is the main risk, or risks, for the success of your project?  What will you
demonstrate during your proof of concept demonstration to convince yourself that
you will be able to overcome this risk?

\section{Expected Technology}

\wss{What programming language or languages do you expect to use?  What external
libraries?  What frameworks?  What technologies.  Are there major components of
the implementation that you expect you will implement, despite the existence of
libraries that provide the required functionality.  For projects with machine
learning, will you use pre-trained models, or be training your own model?  }

\wss{The implementation decisions can, and likely will, change over the course
of the project.  The initial documentation should be written in an abstract way;
it should be agnostic of the implementation choices, unless the implementation
choices are project constraints.  However, recording our initial thoughts on
implementation helps understand the challenge level and feasibility of a
project.  It may also help with early identification of areas where project
members will need to augment their training.}

Topics to discuss include the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item Specific programming language
\item Specific libraries
\item Pre-trained models
\item Specific linter tool (if appropriate)
\item Specific unit testing framework
\item Investigation of code coverage measuring tools
\item Specific plans for Continuous Integration (CI), or an explanation that CI
  is not being done
\item Specific performance measuring tools (like Valgrind), if
  appropriate
\item Tools you will likely be using?
\end{itemize}

\wss{git, GitHub and GitHub projects should be part of your technology.}

\section{Coding Standard}

The team will strictly adhere to and follow the following coding standards to ensure clarity, maintainablity and readability:

  \item

\wss{What coding standard will you adopt?}

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}

\wss{Not required for CAS 741}

\input{../Reflection.tex}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Why is it important to create a development plan prior to starting the
    project?
    \\Having a development plan was crucial for our team because it gave us a shared understanding
    of our goals and responsibilities. I (Aman) realized early on that without a plan, we could 
    easily duplicate work or miss deadlines, like in a previous project where we jumped straight 
    into coding and ended up wasting time fixing miscommunication. Ajay mentioned that in his co-op, 
    projects without clear roles caused constant confusion, so he emphasized setting up structured 
    responsibilities and rotating roles and meeting lead. Savinay shared that documenting meeting agendas 
    and communication methods helped him stay accountable he had seen other projects waste time on 
    unstructured meetings. Gourob, drawing from his experience in AI-focused work, pointed out that 
    a well-documented technical workflow prevents misunderstandings about modules like speech recognition 
    or NLP if we intend to use those to achieve our goals. Overall, the plan helped us coordinate efficiently, 
    understand dependencies, and feel confident moving forward.
    \item In your opinion, what are the advantages and disadvantages of using
    CI/CD?
    \\ Our team had a lot of discussion about CI/CD and its implications. Savinay thought the biggest advantage 
    is catching integration issues early; he recalled a project where manual merges led to significant delays, 
    which could have been avoided with automated pipelines. I (Aman) agreed, but also noted that over-reliance 
    on automated tests can be frustrating when debugging, especially if tests fail unexpectedly as I experienced 
    in a small personal project. Gourob, who has worked with AI pipelines before, emphasized that CI/CD ensures 
    multiple interdependent modules, like speech recognition and text-to-speech, remain stable even as different 
    developers make frequent changes. Ajay raised the practical concern that setting up CI/CD initially is 
    time consuming and misconfigurations can be discouraging, but he concluded that the long-term benefits, 
    such as reliability and reduced errors, outweigh these challenges. Collectively, we agreed that CI/CD will help 
    us maintain a high-quality codebase, streamline collaboration, and catch potential problems early before they escalate.
    \item What disagreements did your group have in this deliverable, if any,
    and how did you resolve them?
    \\Our team had a few meaningful disagreements while preparing this deliverable, mainly around the level of detail
    for our workflow and how to structure GitHub issues. Gourob argued for very detailed issue tracking and branching
    rules because in his previous co-op, unclear workflows had caused confusion and delayed delivery. I (Aman) thought 
    a simpler approach would be faster and less bureaucratic, based on a personal experience where over planning slowed 
    down a small project unnecessarily. Ajay was concerned that if we over complicated the workflow, weekly meetings would 
    become too long and tedious. Savinay suggested a compromise: we would document the main workflow in the development 
    plan but leave flexibility within GitHub issues for the finer technical details.The resolution involved more than 
    just compromise it was about understanding each other’s reasoning. We each shared past experiences, explained why 
    we preferred our approach, and considered potential consequences of both over-planning and under planning. In the 
    end, we created a workflow that balanced structure and flexibility. This disagreement actually strengthened our 
    team dynamic because it forced us to communicate openly, respect different perspectives, and make decisions based 
    on practical experience rather than assumptions.
