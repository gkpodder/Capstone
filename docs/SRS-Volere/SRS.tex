\section{Purpose of the Project}
\subsection{User Business}
Proxi is an AI-powered desktop assistant that lets people operate a computer
entirely through natural speech. It targets users who face barriers with traditional
input devices (keyboard, mouse, complex UIs) and organizations that want to provide
inclusive access to essential digital tasks (communication, learning, work). Proxi
augments independence and reduces the digital divide by turning voice into safe,
precise computer actions. While accessibility is the primary driver, Proxi is
equally intended for general users who want faster, lower‑friction workflows so it
benefits both disabled and non‑disabled users.

\subsection{Goals of the Project}
\begin{description}
\item[G-1 (Latency)] Spoken system responses for common commands shall begin within 
$\leq$ 2.0 s from end-of-speech in a quiet environment.

\item[G-2 (Recognition Accuracy)] Command recognition accuracy for supported 
language(s) in quiet environment shall be $\geq$ 90\% intent-level accuracy.

\item[G-3 (Task Coverage)] Users from the primary user group shall complete $\geq$ 
80\% of a predefined core task suite (open app/file, browse, compose, save, 
schedule) using voice or keyboard.

\item[G-4 (Effectiveness)] Compared to baseline (traditional input for same users), 
Proxi shall improve task completion rate by $\geq$ 20\%.

\item[G-5 (Satisfaction)] Accessibility-focused usability tests shall yield 4.0/5.0 satisfaction score.

\item[G-6 (Stretch Goals)] Voice recognition improvements, offline capabilities, 
multimodal interaction support, personalized profiles, enhanced accessibility
\end{description}
\section{Stakeholders}
\subsection{Client}
The clients for this project are the SFWRENG 4G06A Capstone teaching team at 
McMaster University (course Instructor and assigned Teaching Assistants), serving 
as the product owners on behalf of the department. Their mandate is to ensure the 
solution meets accessibility, usability, and engineering quality standards 
appropriate for a capstone deliverable and potential real‑world piloting within 
academic environments. They provide domain expectations (accessibility best 
practices, privacy/compliance constraints in academic settings) and approve scope 
and milestones.
\subsection{Customer}
Our customers are the end-users and organizations that will deploy Proxi to enable
inclusive and more efficient computer use:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Educational institutions} (libraries, computer labs, accessibility
  services) seeking hands-free or low-friction access to standard desktops and web
  apps.
  \item \textbf{Healthcare and community organizations} supporting users with motor,
  vision, or hearing challenges.
  \item \textbf{General consumers and power users} who prefer faster, voice-first or
  mixed-modality workflows.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Other Stakeholders}
Other stakeholders include any person or group with interest beyond the client and
the customer:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Team Proxi (development team):} responsible for requirements, design,
  implementation, testing, and deployment artefacts.
  \item \textbf{Course Staff (Instructor \& TA):} guidance, assessment, feedback, and
  approvals.
  \item \textbf{Accessibility Advisors (if engaged):} best practices for WCAG/AT
  compatibility.
  \item \textbf{Pilot participants:} individuals who will use the system during user
  studies and provide feedback.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Hands-On Users of the Project}
Primary hands-on users who will directly interact with Proxi:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Accessibility-focused users:} People with motor impairments or
  temporary/situational limitations needing hands-free or simplified control.
  \item \textbf{General users/power users:} Users seeking faster workflows via
  voice/text commands with optional keyboard/mouse confirmation.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Personas}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{P1: Amrita (72) - Elderly User:} Amrita is a retired teacher who uses
  her desktop to check emails, pay bills, and video call her family. She struggles
  with small buttons, complicated menus, and remembering multi-step actions, which
  makes her anxious about using technology. She needs a way to perform common tasks
  more easily and with clear guidance to feel confident online.

  \item \textbf{P2: Leo (21) - User with Motor Disability:} Leo is a computer science
  student who finds it difficult to use a keyboard or mouse due to a motor
  impairment. He needs to read PDFs, take notes, and switch between different apps
  for his coursework. He requires a way to interact with his computer hands-free and
  complete his work without relying on physical input.

  \item \textbf{P3: Ari (28) - Power User:} Ari works with spreadsheets, emails, and
  web tools throughout the day and often repeats the same steps over and over.
  Switching between programs slows him down, and remembering different commands and
  shortcuts is frustrating. He needs a more efficient way to complete multi-step
  tasks and manage his work without constant interruptions.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Priorities Assigned to Users}
The \textbf{highest priority} users for this project are \textbf{accessibility-focused} users, 
including elderly users like Amrita and users with motor impairments like Leo, as 
the main goal is to improve computer access and usability for people who face 
physical challenges or find current systems difficult to use. Their needs guide 
the core features and design decisions of the project. \textbf{Power users} like Ari are 
the \textbf{secondary priority} because, while they do not face accessibility barriers, 
their focus on speed and efficiency helps shape advanced features that make the 
system useful to a wider audience. Prioritizing these groups ensures the solution 
is both inclusive for those who need accessibility support and valuable for 
everyday users seeking more efficient workflows.
\subsection{User Participation}
Estimated participation during the project will primarily involve end users and the
development team. Accessibility-focused users are expected to participate for about 1
hour per week through remote or in-lab sessions focused on usability testing,
feedback, and formative evaluations. General users and power users will contribute
roughly 1 hour per week by taking part in efficiency and performance testing of new
features. Additionally, the development team will dedicate around 8–10 hours per week
to designing, building, testing, and refining the system based on user feedback and
project milestones.
\subsection{Maintenance Users and Service Technicians}
The primary maintenance users for this project will be the development team. During the
capstone project, they will be responsible for identifying and fixing issues, releasing 
updates and patches, and ensuring that the system continues to function as expected throughout 
development. They will also create and maintain documentation such as installation guides and
user manuals to support future use and potential handoff of the project after completion.

\end{description}

\section{Relevant Facts And Assumptions}
\subsection{Relevant Facts}
\begin{description}
  \item[1:] The Proxi's main goal is to enable hands-free computer control
  through natural language commands for disabled users. It also provides
  users with a more efficient workflow. Tasks include opening applications,
  reading and writing files, browsing the web, and scheduling events.
  Interaction with Proxi is via voice command, with a textual input option.

  \item[2:] The system will run on desktop operating systems (Windows, macOS)
  and will engage with many common applications (web browsers, email clients,
  and documents/file browsers).

  \item[3:] Since certain actions can be considered high risk, such as deleting
  files or changing system settings, the system will confirm with the user
  before performing such risky actions that can potentially have destructive
  or sensitive outcomes.
\end{description}
\subsection{Business Rules}
Proxi must get user consent before accessing or handling any personal data.
It must minimize the amount of data shared with external sources, sending only
what is strictly needed to fulfill the user's command.
Any command or action that involves high risk (deleting data, changing system
settings, installing software, etc.) must be confirmed by the user before
execution.
All actions performed should be recorded in an audit log, allowing tracking of
what the AI has done so incorrect actions can be traced and reversed if needed.
Tools used by the AI can only run within a user permission scope, meaning they
can only access and perform actions on resources the user has explicitly
allowed.

\subsection{Assumptions}
\begin{description}
  \item[Hardware] The user has a working computer with a microphone and audio
  output, capable of running the software on a modern OS (Windows, macOS).
  \item[Permissions] The user can grant the permissions needed by the AI agent
  (microphone, screen access, automation APIs) and can run the MCP server.
  \item[Internet] The user has a reliable internet connection to use the AI
  agent, as the LLM and online tools (browser, web search) require connectivity.
  \item[Environment and Language] The user is in a quiet environment where the
  microphone can pick up sound clearly, and will speak in a supported language
  (English).
\end{description}

\section{The Scope of the Work}
\subsection{The Current Situation}
In the current computing landscape, many individuals face barriers when interacting 
with traditional computer interfaces such as keyboards, mice, and complex graphical 
user interfaces. People with motor disabilities, visual impairments, elderly users, 
or those lacking technical proficiency often struggle to perform basic computer tasks 
efficiently. Existing digital assistants (e.g., Siri, Alexa, or Google Assistant) 
provide limited task execution and lack deep integration with desktop environments 
or productivity applications. As a result, accessibility remains a significant challenge, 
and there is a growing demand for more adaptive, intelligent, and inclusive systems 
that can understand user intent through natural language and perform meaningful 
actions across software environments.
\subsection{The Context of the Work}
The proposed project aims to develop an AI-powered assistive technology platform 
designed to improve computer accessibility by leveraging natural language processing, 
speech recognition, and intelligent task automation. The system will act as an intermediary 
between the user and the computer, interpreting spoken or textual commands and 
executing them through modular software agents. These agents will be capable of 
reasoning, planning, and performing actions such as sending emails, browsing the 
web, or managing files. The work will combine accessibility design principles with 
AI technologies to create an inclusive experience that empowers users who cannot 
easily interact with conventional input devices.
\subsection{Work Partitioning}
The work will be divided into the following major components:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Input and Recognition Layer:} Responsible for capturing and processing user input through speech recognition or text interfaces.
    \item \textbf{Natural Language Understanding (NLU):} Converts the user’s intent into structured commands that can be acted upon by the agent system.
    \item \textbf{Agent Planning and Execution Layer:} Deploys intelligent agents capable of reasoning, planning, and interacting with tools or APIs to achieve user goals.
    \item \textbf{Feedback and Output Layer:} Returns the results of executed actions to the user through text or synthesized speech, ensuring clarity and accessibility.
    \item \textbf{Accessibility and Usability Design:} Focused on interface simplicity, adaptive behavior, and inclusive design for users with various needs.
    \item \textbf{Evaluation and Testing:} Involves user studies and performance evaluation to ensure reliability, accuracy, and user satisfaction.
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Specifying a Business Use Case (BUC)}
\textbf{BUC–01: Intelligent Accessibility Assistant}

\noindent
\textbf{Primary Actor:} User (individual with limited mobility or low computer literacy)\\
\textbf{Goal:} To perform computer-based tasks through natural speech or text commands without relying on traditional input devices.

\noindent
\textbf{Preconditions:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The user has access to a device with a microphone, speaker, and internet connectivity.
    \item The assistive system is installed and running in the background.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
\textbf{Main Flow:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The user issues a command such as “Open my email and send a message to my doctor.”
    \item The system processes the speech or text input and identifies the intended task.

    \item The system executes the corresponding steps (e.g., opens an email client, composes a message, and sends it).
    \item The system provides feedback to the user confirming the task completion.
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
\textbf{Alternative Flows:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item If the system cannot interpret the user’s request, it will ask clarifying questions.
    \item If a required tool or permission is missing, the system will notify the user and suggest corrective actions.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
\textbf{Postconditions:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The requested action is completed successfully or an appropriate message is returned.
    \item The system logs the interaction for future learning and performance improvement.
\end{itemize}

\section{The Scope of the Product}

\subsection{Product Boundary}
Proxi is a desktop helper that lets people run their computer with short voice or
text commands. In this project, Proxi listens, figures out what the user means,
asks for a quick confirmation when needed, and then carries out the task on the
local machine through tools (MCP).

\textbf{In-Scope Features:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Input and understanding:} Listen for a request, interpret the
  intent, and ask a brief follow-up if there are multiple matches. Learn about
  the user's system and common tasks as time goes on to make Proxi more
  efficient.
  \item \textbf{Desktop actions via MCP:} Perform common tasks such as: open an
  app or file, learn and interact with user apps, browse/search, save/move/rename
  files using local tools with least privilege access.
  \item \textbf{Safety and privacy:} Ask before anything destructive, offer a
  simple undo when possible, and keep a short audit trail of what happened.
  \item \textbf{Accessible, plain language:} Show captions for spoken output, use
  readable defaults (contrast/size), and support keyboard or voice for every step.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Out-of-Scope Features:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Replacing full third-party apps (complete email client, calendar, or
  browser).
  \item Unattended background automation, remote administration, or multiple users
  controlling the same desktop session.
  \item Offline language understanding/generation, enterprise policy management,
  or default long-term cloud storage of user data.
\end{itemize}

\caption{Product Use Case Table}
\label{tab:puc-table}
\end{table}

\subsection{Individual Product Use Cases (PUC's)}

\textbf{PUC-01: Open Application}  
The user asks Proxi to open an application by name. If there are several matches,
Proxi lists them and the user picks one. Proxi checks permissions, opens or
focuses the app, and confirms success. If the app isn’t available, Proxi explains
why and suggests the next step.

\textbf{PUC-02: Open and Read File}  
The user asks to open or read a file. Proxi resolves the path or name within the
allowed scope, opens it in the default viewer, and can read a section aloud or
give a short summary on request. If the file can’t be accessed, Proxi says why
and offers alternatives.

\textbf{PUC-03: Browse and Search}  
The user says to go to a certain URL or to search for something, Proxi validates
the URL or forms a search, opens the default browser, and lands on the right
page. If the link looks unsafe, Proxi warns the user and asks for confirmation.

\textbf{PUC-04: Compose Draft}  
The user dictates a short message or email. Proxi extracts recipients and
content, opens a new draft in the default app, and fills in the fields. The user
reviews and sends. If a recipient is unknown, Proxi asks for the address.

\textbf{PUC-05: Save/Organize File}  
The user asks to Save as, Move, or Rename. Proxi checks the target path, handles
name collisions, and asks before any overwrite. After the operation, Proxi
confirms what changed; if it couldn’t proceed, it explains the reason and
options.

\textbf{PUC-06: Interact with User Apps}  
The user asks Proxi to do a simple action inside an app that’s already open (for
example: click a menu item, type a short phrase, press a button, or toggle a
setting). If there’s any ambiguity, Proxi asks a brief follow-up (“Which
button?”) and then performs the action. If the app can’t be controlled, Proxi

  controlling system-level functions is still in progress, and further testing is 
  needed to ensure reliable and safe execution of commands across different 
  applications.

  \item \textbf{OI.2} The system’s compatibility and consistent performance 
  across different operating systems (such as Windows, macOS, and Linux) 
  have not yet been fully tested or confirmed.

  \item \textbf{OI.3} Ensuring that user commands do not unintentionally trigger 
  harmful or unauthorized actions on the device is still under investigation 
  and requires additional safety checks and permission handling.
\end{itemize}


\section{Off-the-Shelf Solutions}
\subsection{Ready-Made Products}
Several existing tools can cover key parts of Proxi so we do not reinvent them:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Speech-to-Text (STT):} Many STT engines can perform microphone
  input and return text with timestamps. Many computers have built-in STT
  software that is free to use.
  \item \textbf{Text-to-Speech (TTS):} OpenAI has its own TTS model that can
  convert text to speech, such as GPT-4o mini TTS.
  \item \textbf{Desktop Automation:} OS-level automation libraries can open
  apps, switch windows, and engage with controls.
  \item \textbf{Language Understanding:} An API to a LLM such as GPT-4o Mini
  can be the head AI agent for understanding user commands and generating plans.
  \item \textbf{Storage and Logging:} A lightweight database (SQLite) or a log
  file can store audit logs and MCP settings with minimal setup.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Reusable Components}
We can reuse or lightly adapt components that are common across desktop
assistants:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{MCP tool skeletons:} A small template for tools and a registry
  storer so new tools are added by convention.
  \item \textbf{OS adapters:} Adapters for Windows/macOS that present the same
  functions (open app, focus window, file operations) behind one interface.
  \item \textbf{Prompt templates:} We can reuse templates for short, reusable
  prompts to open apps, open files, browse/search, and save/move/rename.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Products That Can Be Copied}
We shall adopt proven patterns from familiar tools to speed delivery:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Command palette pattern:} A single search box that finds actions
  and recent items, with arrow-key selection and enter to run it.
  \item \textbf{Clear confirmation modal:} A dialog that states the action in
  simple language, showing what will change, and offers approve/cancel options.
  \item \textbf{Pre-run checklist:} A simple setup that asks for microphone
  permission, automation permission, and desktop control on first use. Whenever
  app access is needed, permission will be requested from the user again before
  executing any further commands.
\end{itemize}

\section{New Problems}
\subsection{Effects on the Current Environment}
The introduction of the AI-powered assistive technology platform may alter how 
users interact with their existing computing environment. Potential effects include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Users may become dependent on natural language commands, reducing direct 
    interaction with traditional interfaces.
    \item Additional system resources (CPU, memory) will be used to run AI agents, 
    which could impact performance of other applications.
    \item There may be changes in user workflows, requiring adaptation to the system’s 
    operational model.
    \item The presence of AI-driven agents could introduce unexpected interactions 
    with other software if not properly sandboxed.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Effects on the Installed Systems}
Integrating the system with existing hardware and software may create compatibility 
challenges:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Existing applications may require updated permissions or APIs to allow 
    agent interactions.
    \item System updates (OS or applications) may temporarily disrupt AI agent 
    functionality.
    \item The system may necessitate installation of additional software libraries 
    or frameworks, which could conflict with pre-existing software.
    \item Increased network usage for cloud-based AI services could affect other 
    applications relying on the same connectivity.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Potential User Problems}
While the system is designed to enhance accessibility, users may encounter challenges:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Misinterpretation of voice commands may lead to incorrect task execution.
    \item Users may feel discomfort or distrust if the system performs unexpected 
    actions.
    \item Cognitive overload may occur if the system provides too much feedback 
    or prompts.
    \item Users with atypical speech patterns or accents may experience reduced 
    recognition accuracy.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Limitations in the Anticipated Implementation Environment That May Inhibit the New Product}
Certain environmental and technical limitations may restrict the effectiveness of 
the platform:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Limited or unstable internet connectivity could hinder cloud-based speech 
    recognition or AI planning.
    \item Hardware constraints (low-end processors, insufficient RAM) may slow down 
    task execution.
    \item Applications with restrictive APIs/security measures may not allow full 
    agent interaction.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Follow-Up Problems}
After deployment, additional challenges may emerge that require monitoring and mitigation:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Continuous maintenance will be needed to ensure compatibility with 
    updated applications and OS versions.
    \item Security and privacy risks from storing or processing user data must be 
    actively managed.
\end{itemize}

\section{Tasks}
\subsection{Project Planning}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The project will follow a iterative and incremental development plan. 
    Early prototyping along with continuous feedback from beta users will help 
    address defects early.
    \item Core stages will include requirements, system design, development, 
    testing, and deployment.
    \item Developers will be responsible for coming up with test cases (unit 
    and functional tests), so sufficient time should also be allocated to 
    writing test cases.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Planning of the Development Phases}
Since development will be interative and incremental, the phases are not 
strictly linear. Development and testing, in particular, will be repeated 
iteratively as part of an incremental cycle. The Development phases will be 
broadly divided into these phases:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Requirements Phase}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Identify what the system must do and it's constraints.
        \item Come up with Functional, Non-Functional requirements.
        \item Gather input from target users.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{System Design Phase}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Create overall system architecture, high level component 
        interactions and integrations.
        \item Select appropriate off-the-shelf LLM model for natural language
        processing and logic
        \item Brainstrom and pick appropriate technology stack.
        \item Create diagrams, mockups and data flow diagrams to aide 
        development.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Development Phase}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Implement system according to design and feedback from previous
        iterations.
        \item Build the user interface using selected technology stack and 
        integrate partner applications and technologies.
        \item Come up with automated and manual test cases for any new features
        added or any change in functionality. These can be added to the 
        automated testing pipelines.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Testing Phase}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Create and conduct comprehensive test suites that include testing
        objectives, failures, successes and stability.
        \item Test the system with representative users, including older adults 
        and users with disabilities, to confirm the interface is intuitive and 
        meets accessibility standards.
        \item Evaluate responsiveness and stability across different hardware 
        setups, including low-spec devices.
        \item Ensure regressions aren't introduced between successive 
        iteractions and that new changes don't break existing features.
        \item Document all testing results and come up with possible 
        improvements for next development iteration.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Deployment Phase}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Ensure that instruction manuals are up to date with latest 
        features.
        \item Ensure installation and initial setup are simple and do not 
        require technical expertise.
        \item Deploy the application using the selected channel. Continuously 
        monitor system performance and user feedback for maintenance and 
        updates.
        \item Maintain version control and update logs so improvements and bug 
        fixes can be tracked systematically
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


\section{Migration to the New Product}
\subsection{Requirements for Migration to the New Product}
There are no special migration steps beyond just installing Proxi and granting
the usual permissions on the first run (microphone, automation, etc.). After
that, for access to any apps and folders, Proxi will request permission again.
Existing workflows and applications will remain the same; users only need to
familiarize themselves with the new voice/text command interface.

\subsection{Data That Has to be Modified or Translated for the New System}
No data conversion is needed. This tool works with the user’s existing files and
applications as they are. The only new data created is potentially a local
configuration file generated. Nothing else needs to be imported or translated
from previous tools.

\section{Costs}
To minimize costs, the project will aim to use open source and off-the-shelf 
solutions whenever possible. Since this project is a student project as part of
a course, development costs will not be taken into consideration. The only costs
associated with development are related to any third-party libraries or any APIs
used by the application. The application itself will be free to use and publicly
available.

\section{User Documentation and Training}
\subsection{User Documentation Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The system shall include a user manual explaining installation, setup,
     and configuration procedures.  
    \item The documentation shall provide step-by-step instructions for performing
     common tasks via speech and text commands.  
    \item The manual shall include troubleshooting guidance for common issues such
     as misinterpreted commands, failed task execution, or connectivity problems.  
    \item The documentation shall provide an explanation of accessibility features,
     including options for speech rate, font size, and interface contrast.  
    \item The system shall include inline help or tooltips within the interface for
     immediate guidance during use.  
    \item Documentation shall be available in multiple formats, including PDF, 
    HTML, and context-sensitive help within the software.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Training Requirements}
There isn't a dedicated training program for the system but the user will be 
provided with example scenarios that they can follow to build intuition on how 
to direct the agentic system.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Users shall be able to complete an introductory tutorial that demonstrates
     how to issue commands and interact with the AI agents.  
    \item The system shall provide interactive training sessions or guided exercises
     to familiarize users with core functionalities such as sending emails, managing 
     files, and performing web searches.  
    \item Training materials shall include examples of natural language commands, 
    including variations in phrasing to account for diverse user speech patterns.  

\end{itemize}

\section{Waiting Room}
These are good ideas we’re keeping on the side for now, as they are not the most
urgent.
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Offline mode:} Basic voice commands without internet using a small
  local model.
  \item \textbf{App plugins:} Simple SDK so other people can add new MCP tools.
  \item \textbf{Interactions with multiple devices:} Start a task on one computer
  and finish on another. For example, computer to computer connection.
  \item \textbf{Custom voice:} Let users pick a voice for Text-to-Speech. A lot of
  TTS engines have many voices to choose from. For now we shall keep it simple
  with one voice.
  \item \textbf{More languages:} Support more languages for voice commands and
  responses.
\end{itemize}

\section{Ideas for Solution}
Proxi should stay simple and safe. The main idea is a small desktop app that
listens for a request, confirms anything risky in plain language, and then runs a
scoped action through a set of MCP tools.
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Local MCP server:} A set of processes expose a bunch of safe tools
  (open app, open file, browse, save/move/rename, click buttons on screen, etc.).
  Each tool runs with low privilege and only within user approved scopes.
  \item \textbf{Lightweight UI:} A simple AI with options for users to click, type,
  or speak. The UI shows status (listening, thinking, ready), captions for spoken
  output, and a few big buttons (listen, stop, undo, approve).
  \item \textbf{Voice in, text out (with captions):} Use a STT engine for
  microphone input and TTS for spoken output. Always show captions to the text that
  is coming out/in.
  \item \textbf{Simple intent handling:} Map common phrases to a small set of
  intents using prompts/templates (Open app, Open file, browse, save/move/rename).
  If unclear, ask one short follow up.
  \item \textbf{Safety by default:} Permission scopes (folders/apps) are chosen at
  setup and can be edited or approved by the user later. Destructive operations
  always require an explicit approval from the user.
  \item \textbf{Traceability:} Keep a short, local audit log. Any sensitive
  information should be kept out of the audit logs.
