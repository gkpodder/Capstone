\section{Purpose of the Project}
\subsection{User Business}
Proxi is an AI-powered desktop assistant that lets people operate a computer
entirely through natural speech. It targets users who face barriers with traditional
input devices (keyboard, mouse, complex UIs) and organizations that want to provide
inclusive access to essential digital tasks (communication, learning, work). Proxi
augments independence and reduces the digital divide by turning voice into safe,
precise computer actions. While accessibility is the primary driver, Proxi is
equally intended for general users who want faster, lower‑friction workflows so it
benefits both disabled and non‑disabled users.

\subsection{Goals of the Project}
\begin{description}
\item[G-1 (Latency)] Spoken system responses for common commands shall begin within 
$\leq$ 2.0 s from end-of-speech in a quiet environment.

\item[G-2 (Recognition Accuracy)] Command recognition accuracy for supported 
language(s) in quiet environment shall be $\geq$ 90\% intent-level accuracy.

\item[G-3 (Task Coverage)] Users from the primary user group shall complete $\geq$ 
80\% of a predefined core task suite (open app/file, browse, compose, save, 
schedule) using voice or keyboard.

\item[G-4 (Effectiveness)] Compared to baseline (traditional input for same users), 
Proxi shall improve task completion rate by $\geq$ 20\%.

\item[G-5 (Satisfaction)] Accessibility-focused usability tests shall yield 4.0/5.0 satisfaction score.

\item[G-6 (Stretch Goals)] Voice recognition improvements, offline capabilities, 
multimodal interaction support, personalized profiles, enhanced accessibility
\end{description}
\section{Stakeholders}
\subsection{Client}
The clients for this project are the SFWRENG 4G06A Capstone teaching team at 
McMaster University (course Instructor and assigned Teaching Assistants), serving 
as the product owners on behalf of the department. Their mandate is to ensure the 
solution meets accessibility, usability, and engineering quality standards 
appropriate for a capstone deliverable and potential real‑world piloting within 
academic environments. They provide domain expectations (accessibility best 
practices, privacy/compliance constraints in academic settings) and approve scope 
and milestones.
\subsection{Customer}
Our customers are the end-users and organizations that will deploy Proxi to enable 
inclusive and more efficient computer use:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Educational institutions} (libraries, computer labs, accessibility services) 
  seeking hands-free or low-friction access to standard desktops and web apps
\item \textbf{Healthcare and community organizations} supporting users with motor/vision/
  hearing challenges
\item \textbf{General consumers and power users} who prefer faster, voice-first or mixed-
  modality workflows

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Other Stakeholders}
Other stakeholders include any person or group with interest beyond the client and 
the customer:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Team Proxi (development team):} responsible for requirements, design, 
  implementation, testing, and deployment artefacts
\item \textbf{Course Staff (Instructor \& TA):} guidance, assessment, feedback, and 
  approvals
\item \textbf{Accessibility Advisors (if engaged):} best practices for WCAG/AT compatibility
\item \textbf{Pilot participants:} individuals who will use the system during user studies 
  and provide feedback
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Hands-On Users of the Project}
Primary hands-on users who will directly interact with Proxi:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Accessibility-focused users:} People with motor impairments or 
  temporary/situational limitations needing hands-free or simplified control
\item \textbf{General users/power users:} Users seeking faster workflows via 
  voice/text commands with optional keyboard/mouse confirmation
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Personas}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{P1: Amrita (72) - Elderly User:} Amrita is a retired teacher who uses her desktop to 
check emails, pay bills, and video call her family. She struggles with small buttons, 
complicated menus, and remembering multi-step actions, which makes her anxious about 
using technology. She needs a way to perform common tasks more easily and with clear 
guidance to feel confident online.

\item \textbf{P2: Leo (21) - User with Motor Disability:} Leo is a computer science student who finds
it difficult to use a keyboard or mouse due to a motor impairment. He needs to read PDFs,
take notes, and switch between different apps for his coursework. He requires a way to 
interact with his computer hands-free and complete his work without relying on physical 
input.

\item \textbf{P3: Ari (28) - Power User:} Ari works with spreadsheets, emails, and web tools 
throughout the day and often repeats the same steps over and over. Switching between 
programs slows him down, and remembering different commands and shortcuts is frustrating. 
He needs a more efficient way to complete multi-step tasks and manage his work without 
constant interruptions.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Priorities Assigned to Users}
The \textbf{highest priority} users for this project are \textbf{accessibility-focused} users, 
including elderly users like Amrita and users with motor impairments like Leo, as 
the main goal is to improve computer access and usability for people who face 
physical challenges or find current systems difficult to use. Their needs guide 
the core features and design decisions of the project. \textbf{Power users} like Ari are 
the \textbf{secondary priority} because, while they do not face accessibility barriers, 
their focus on speed and efficiency helps shape advanced features that make the 
system useful to a wider audience. Prioritizing these groups ensures the solution 
is both inclusive for those who need accessibility support and valuable for 
everyday users seeking more efficient workflows.
\subsection{User Participation}
Estimated participation during the project will primarily involve end users and the
development team. Accessibility-focused users are expected to participate for about 1
hour per week through remote or in-lab sessions focused on usability testing,
feedback, and formative evaluations. General users and power users will contribute
roughly 1 hour per week by taking part in efficiency and performance testing of new
features. Additionally, the development team will dedicate around 8–10 hours per week
to designing, building, testing, and refining the system based on user feedback and
project milestones.
\subsection{Maintenance Users and Service Technicians}
The primary maintenance users for this project will be the development team. During the
capstone project, they will be responsible for identifying and fixing issues, releasing 
updates and patches, and ensuring that the system continues to function as expected throughout 
development. They will also create and maintain documentation such as installation guides and
user manuals to support future use and potential handoff of the project after completion.
