## Project Description
This project is an AI-powered assistive technology platform designed to make computers more accessible for individuals who face barriers with traditional interfaces, such as people with disabilities, elderly users, or those unfamiliar with digital devices.
At its core, the system combines speech recognition, natural language understanding, and text-to-speech to allow users to control and interact with a computer entirely through their voice. Instead of navigating menus, using a mouse, or typing, users can simply speak naturally to the system, which responds with clear, human-like speech.

The folders and files for this project are as follows:

docs - Documentation for the project
refs - Reference material used for the project, including papers
src - Source code
test - Test cases
etc.
